## Modern Background System - Using Sample Images from Unsplash

The website now uses professional sample images from Unsplash (free stock photos) for modern backgrounds.

### Current Implementation:
The system automatically uses high-quality educational/school images from Unsplash:
- **Hero Sections**: Professional school/education images
- **Background Collages**: Multiple school-related images in modern compositions
- **All images**: Optimized for web with proper sizing parameters

### Image Sources (Unsplash):
1. School/Education themed images
2. Student learning environments
3. Modern educational facilities
4. Classroom and academic settings

### Features:
- ✅ **No upload required** - Images load automatically from Unsplash
- ✅ **Professional quality** - High-resolution stock photos
- ✅ **Modern overlay gradients** - Brand-colored overlays
- ✅ **Parallax effects** - Smooth scrolling backgrounds
- ✅ **Blur and filter effects** - Professional visual styling

### Optional: Custom Images
If you want to use your own school images instead:
1. Add images to this directory (`static/img/`)
2. Update the image URLs in `static/css/modern-background.css` and templates
3. Recommended naming: `school-hero.jpg`, `school-about.jpg`, `school-bg-1.jpg`, etc.
